# XMLOnlineOrder

This series primarily looks at using PHPs XMLReader Class to read an simple XML file.
It uses the SimpleXMLElement class to make sense of the nodes and sub-elements and utilises these in a custom class to make file interaction cleaner.

This series is designed for beginners who already have an understanding of HTML and covers a range of basic techniques.
